# Indian Domestic Flight Price Analysis

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of flight ticket prices for major Indian domestic routes. The goal is to uncover patterns that determine flight costs, such as the airline, time of booking, and month of travel. The entire analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, culminating in an auto-generated summary dashboard in Excel.

## üéØ Project Goal

As a data analyst for a travel comparison website, the objective is to answer key questions for consumers:
1.  Which airlines are consistently the most and least expensive?
2.  How does flight price vary based on the month of travel?
3.  What are the most expensive routes?
4.  Provide actionable insights to help travelers save money.
